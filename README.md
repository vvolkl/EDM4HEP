The tests and examples in the `tests` directory show how to read, write, and use these types in your code.


## Status

This project is in a beta stage -- feedback and use of it in production is encouraged, but expect changes until a stable version is released in some weeks.

## Dependencies

Required:

* [PODIO](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio) >= v00-09-02
* [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root) >= v6.18/04   

Optional:

* Doxygen (to build code reference)
* HepMC (integration test)
* HepPDT (integration test)
* TrickTrack (integration test)

## Build and Install

This project follows the key4hep guidelines and can be build with CMake:

```
git clone https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep
cd EDM4hep; mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
``` 

The library files and dictionaries (`libedm4hep.so`, ...) must be put somewhere in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
